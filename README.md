# Sentiment-Span-Extraction-Using-Transformer-Models

## Objective

Pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the labeled sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). In other words, construct a model that can look at the labeled sentiment for a given tweet and figure out what word or phrase best supports it.

Eg:- 

Tweet:- "My ridiculous dog is amazing." 
Labeled sentiment:- positive
Predict:- "amazing"

Tweet:- "Sick. With a flu like thing." 
Labeled sentiment:- negative
Predict:- "Sick."
